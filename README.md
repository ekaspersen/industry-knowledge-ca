## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind-css
- HTML
- Javascript
- Prettier
- Vite
- Husky

### What I learned

Easier way to write in tailwind elements, without writing the same long code many times in the HTML.

```css
@layer components {
  .inner {
    /*Put me on every section except for .my-work*/
    @apply mx-auto max-w-[1100px];
  }
}
```

### Run commands

- 1. installing node modules: [npm i]
- 2. create a build directory: [npm run build]
- 3. run the script inside package.json: [npm run dev]
- 4. preview the build locally: [npm run preview]
